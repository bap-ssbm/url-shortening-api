## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- tailwindCSS
- ReactJS
- Framer-Motion
- Mobile-first workflow
- shrtcode API
- Axios


### What I learned

I learned alot from this project. I learned that using tailwind for animations rather than framer-motion in some situations is better and easier to use.
i learned that there is a function that can let user copy a variable by clicking on a button.
learned a bit more how to do axios, this time, i manually wrote the code of getting the api myself. Getting better at making clean framer-motion animations. and also tailwind CSS. its becoming a bit more second nature to me.
Although sometimes i have to look at the documentation.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
